# Project
Hospital management system with socket programming to enable communication with several computers on the computer network to be used by either nurses for updating vitals of patients, or doctors for viewing patients' vitals

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

This app displays the doctor's dashboard. It should be up and running while the other system app is run on another tab.
